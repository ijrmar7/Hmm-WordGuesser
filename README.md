# Hmm? - A Word Guesser Game 🤔🕹️

📝🔍🤔 Hmm? - A Word Guesser Game is a Java program that challenges you to guess a randomly chosen word. The program displays a series of dashes that represent the letters in the word. Your goal is to guess the word by inputting the whole word at once. The program checks if the word is correct and displays a message to indicate whether the guess was correct or incorrect. You can continue guessing words until you either correctly guess the entire word or run out of attempts.


## 🕹️ How to Play

🕹️ To play Hmm? - A Word Guesser Game, simply run the program and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be prompted to input a word for each guess. The number of attempts you have is based on the length of the randomly chosen word. For example, if the word is 5 letters long, you will have 6 attempts. If you run out of attempts before correctly guessing the word, the game will end and you lose.

🔍 To help you guess the word, Hmm? - A Word Guesser Game includes a hint system. If a letter you entered is in the word to guess and also at the correct position, the background of the letter will be green. If the letter is in the word to guess but not at the correct position, the background of the letter will be yellow. If the letter is not in the word to guess, the background of the letter will be red.
